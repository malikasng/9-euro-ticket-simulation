# 9-euro-ticket-simulation
On the 1st of June 2022, the 9 Euro ticket was introduced, allowing every person which bought it to travel throughout Germany using regional transport for just 9 Euros per month, from June till August. This has had a clear effect on the way in which people commute and use transportation services, be it for work or school, or just recreationally. Delays, cancellations, accidents and overpopulation are just a few of the noticeable changes. Factors such as time of day, day of the week, state of the passengers and temperature all take their toll in the experience of the people who use public transportation. The aim of this project is to model, visualize and predict the extent to which these factors, together with the dynamic the 9 Euro ticket has introduced, have impacted the way in which people travel.
